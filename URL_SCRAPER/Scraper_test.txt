Text: Global Monoethylene Glycol Market - Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic
Text: The COVID-19 had a negative influence on the global monoethylene glycol market. China is the largest supplier and user of mono-ethylene glycol in Asia-Pacific, owing to the country's expanding population and urbanization, which has resulted in high demand from the textile industry. However, the supply chain has been disrupted due to the COVID-19-triggered lockdown, which hampered the global monoethylene glycol market growth. In addition, the pandemic's spread has a detrimental effect on the majority of people's overall economic circumstances.  Consumer demand has fallen, and consumers are concentrating more on reducing their budgets' non-essential spending.
Text: Global Monoethylene Glycol  Market: Recent Developments
Text: Asia-Pacific region held dominant position in the global monoethylene glycol market in 2022, accounting for 78% share in terms of volume, followed by and Europe and Asia Pacific respectively.

Text: *Definition: Monoethylene glycol can be found in polyester fibers and films. It is one of the greatest products for making polyester fibers and Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) films because of its resilience and hydrophobic qualities. Monoethylene glycol is used in various industries including construction, automotive, consumer goods, textiles, medicines, and chemical processing. Monoethylene glycol production has increased in response to the growing demand for polyester fiber in the textile industry. The global monoethylene glycol market growth is predicted to be driven by the increasing use of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in major consumer goods products such as bottles and food containers. People's changing lifestyles and urbanization in major nations such as China, India, Brazil, and Mexico are likely to drive the demand for monoethylene glycol.
